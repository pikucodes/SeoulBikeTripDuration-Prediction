# BIKE TRIP DURATION PREDICTION
**Motivation for the project-This project was implemented from a research paper idea,where based on different weather and geographical factors inside a city named Seoul,duration of bike trip was being predicted.Trip duration in public rental bikes is a notable example of a travel analytics problem which profits from data analysis. Knowing the estimated trip duration in advance helps the government organisations and also the travellers as in case of picking the right choice on route planning and timing. For this reason, information on bike trips (more likely GPS data) obtained by rental bikes can be utilised.**
