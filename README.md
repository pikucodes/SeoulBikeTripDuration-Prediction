# BIKE TRIP DURATION PREDICTION

**MOTIVATION FOR THE PROJECT-This project was implemented from a research paper idea,where based on different weather conditions,geographical factors and time parameters(day of month,day of week,etc),duration of bike trip was being predicted for bike trips for a bike rental services company operating inside Seoul city.**

**BUSINESS VALUE-Trip duration in public rental bikes is a notable example of a travel analytics problem which profits from data analysis. Knowing the estimated trip duration in advance helps the government organisations and also the travellers as in case of picking the right choice on route planning and timing. For this reason, information on bike trips (more likely GPS data) obtained by rental bikes can be utilised.Moreover the bike rental company with the help of an estimated duration for a particular trip can benefit directly by detecting whether the bike was ridden directly without halt or it was taken to somewhere else in between.This can help them detect and penalize the fraudulent bike riders who may have used the bike for some other purposes rather than using it for official rental trips only**
